# Travel Log - Introduction
Hello! After travelling to many different countries, and participating in tons of different activities, I began to lement forgetting the small off-hand moments that made life so special. I created this website so people would be able to keep track of the places they have been, the things they have done, and even places they are  planning to go.

This website's structure is quite simple for ease of use. The entries are timestamped, and ordered thusly. With the most recent appearing on the top.
